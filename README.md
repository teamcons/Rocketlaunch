# -Rocketlaunch!

A program to create new projects, in the right place, super super quick and how I want it, because I am lazy and impatient.
On the technical aspect, it is a Powershell script, written in imperative style, using Windows.Forms as GUI and compiled into PS2EXE. 
I am learning powershell as i write and expand it. Its bound to have some ugly and some clever code.
The manual is for coworkers who may want to use it.

Load the last few emails with attachments from Outlook
Load folder structure from templates
Create in the appropriate structure the folders,
include source files from email with attachments, proper place and naming conventions.

As we charge by the word, count words in Word, Powerpoint, PDF, TXT, create an analysis Excel file and copy total to clipboard
As we work in Trados Studio, pre-fill and start the New Project assistant

Todo :
-Choose whether to get source files from emails, Downloads folder, or None. Listview for the two latters, with icons
-Load for real from a CSV, and a button to load others. Also icons.
-Have the Help button do something
